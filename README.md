#Launcher Panel
This is a standalone project for the custom layout panel used in the **launcher*** project.
Most important element is the `PanoramaPanel`, which has page-based fluid behavior. It was designed with the **launcher** project in mind, therefore it may have numerous limitations that complicate it's use as a general-purpose layout panel. However, the code clearly demonstrates how fluid behavior works in WPF, and therefore would be an excellent basis for developing custom general-purpose fluid layouts.
